# Changelog

## 0.1.0-alpha.7

- Add local authenticated Web console inspired by the 8790 asset center: named source/target selection, bounded summary preview, queued hook injection, receipt states, per-session summary backends and an actual local MCP handshake test button.
- MCP `lcm_context` returns a bounded navigation packet directly to the calling agent; `lcm_enqueue_context` queues cross-conversation delivery. Claude/Codex hooks can offer queued packets on next prompt/start. No claim of forced model use.
- Add isolated `codex exec --json --ephemeral` summarization backend and optional main-agent summary work/save tools, gated per session with source hash verification. Main-agent mode is off by default.

## 0.1.0-alpha.6

- Add Codex CLI Stop/PostCompact/SessionEnd hook adapter with bounded local transcript paths, independent session IDs and background summaries; Codex compaction stays native.
- Persist original harness and conversation ID with native Claude/Codex title records when available and derived/manual title precedence. Resolve by exact name or ID without guessing ambiguous titles; expose provenance on summaries and source reads.
- Skip model calls for metadata-only transcript batches and migrate prior alpha.5 session metadata in place.

## 0.1.0-alpha.5

- Make the local MCP store cross-harness: preserve session origin, support portable and Codex-shaped JSONL imports, and expose paginated independent summary nodes per conversation to any MCP client.
- Add Codex MCP registration guidance and retain the existing SQLite home/config path for existing Claude indexes. Automatic capture remains Claude-specific until another harness supplies a transcript adapter.

## 0.1.0-alpha.4

- Replace main-agent summary writing with an isolated background Claude CLI subprocess using the local subscription login and configurable `SUPERLCM_CLAUDE_CLI_MODEL`; retain explicitly selected API mode.
- Remove agent summary MCP tools and prompt-injection hook; guard recursive hooks and API/environment leakage. Legacy `agent` mode settings map to the background worker without deleting old nodes.

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

- Select agent mode by default and switch exclusively to API mode when the dedicated summarizer key is configured; suppress prompts and gate agent MCP writes to prevent duplicate summaries.
- Persist the hook-selected mode per session so separately launched MCP processes enforce the same policy.

## 0.1.0-alpha.2

- Add optional active-Claude summary work and validated hierarchical persistence; keep API-backed background summaries as a separate mode.
- Support local Claude Code sessions in the Desktop Code tab using the same hooks and MCP configuration.

## 0.1.0-alpha.1

- Extract Claude Code CLI and Desktop recall adapter as an independent package with no DSH compaction integration.
